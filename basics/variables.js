const accountId = 1234  //constant value - means value cannot be changed , if you change it will throw error
accountId = 2
let accountPassword= "23245"
var accountCity= "Jaipur"

// never use var - it has scope problem , i.e. - if you change one variable named password it will change the value of all variables named password irrespective of block or scope
